Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. This simulation uses a two-dimensional grid of cells that evolve at each iteration based on a set of rules:

    A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.

    A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.

    All other cells die or remain dead.

The board is displayed in the terminal, and updates over a set number of iterations with a delay between each step.
